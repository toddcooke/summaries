# summaries

ACID
- Atomic - The transaction completely succeeds or falis
- Consistent - Data will be valid before and after a transaction
- Isolated - Transactions can happen concurrently
- Durable - The results of a transaction are saved to disk

Eventual Consistency - Reads after writes may not reflect latest writes

REST - Representational State Transfer
1. Client-Server - Client and server can change independently: they are decoupled
1. Stateless - Server does not retain state of client
1. Cacheable - Some responses may be cached by the server
  - GET and HEAD
  - 200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, and 501
  - No cache preventing headers, like Cache-Control
1. Uniform Interface
1. Layered System
1. (Optional) Code on demand
